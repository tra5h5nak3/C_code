// DESCRIPTION
// a program that reads in a five digit integer and determines whether or not itâ€™s a palindrome. 




int main(void){

    int number;                             // The number the user inputs as well as the divison math variable

    int math;                               // The variable used to compute remainder operator

    int a,b,c,d,e;                          // The variables assigned to keep the order of numbers from right to left
                                            // "a" = rightmost number from user input, "e" being the left most number from user input

    int check =0;                           // Boolean variable, where "check = 0" means it is palindrome, "check != 0" means false 
    int original;
